Prediction markets are platforms where people trade on the outcomes of future events, creating accurate forecasts through the wisdom of crowds.

## How They Work

### Basic Concept
1. A question about a future event is posed
2. Traders buy shares in different outcomes
3. Share prices reflect probability
4. Market resolves when outcome is known
5. Winners receive payouts

### Simple Example
**Question**: "Will it rain tomorrow?"
- YES shares: $0.70 (70% chance)
- NO shares: $0.30 (30% chance)
