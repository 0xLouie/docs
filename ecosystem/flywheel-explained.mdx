## The Prediqt Flywheel

The Prediqt flywheel is a carefully designed economic mechanism that creates a positive feedback loop, where platform growth directly benefits token holders and attracts more users.

<Callout type="success" emoji="ðŸ”„">
  Unlike traditional platforms where value flows to shareholders, Prediqt's flywheel ensures value accrues to users and token holders through automated buybacks and burns.
</Callout>

## The Five Stages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Platform Activity" icon="1">
    ### Users Drive Volume
    
    Every bet placed on Prediqtmarket generates fees:
    - Trading fees (2%)
    - Developer fees (0.5%)
    - Early exit fees (1%)
    
    More users = More bets = More fees
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fee Accumulation" icon="2">
    ### Treasury Builds Value
    
    Fees flow into the protocol treasury:
    - Automated collection via smart contracts
    - Transparent on-chain accounting
    - No manual intervention needed
    
    Current treasury: View on [Treasury Dashboard](https://prediqt.market/treasury)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automated Buybacks" icon="3">
    ### Market Purchases Begin
    
    When treasury hits thresholds:
    - Smart contract triggers buyback
    - Purchases $PREDIQT from DEX
    - Creates consistent buy pressure
    - No human decision-making
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Value Distribution" icon="4">
    ### Token Holders Benefit
    
    Bought tokens are:
    - 50% distributed to stakers
    - 50% permanently burned
    - Reduces circulating supply
    - Increases scarcity
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enhanced Attraction" icon="5">
    ### Growth Accelerates
    
    Rising token value creates:
    - Better staking rewards
    - Increased fee savings
    - More users joining
    - Higher platform volume
    
    **The cycle repeats, stronger each time**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mathematical Model

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Example">
    **Assumptions:**
    - Daily volume: $1M
    - Developer fee: 0.5%
    - Daily fees: $5,000
    - Weekly buyback: $35,000
    
    **Results:**
    - Annual buybacks: $1.82M
    - If token price 2x: Same $ buys 50% fewer tokens
    - Creates natural price support
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Growth Scenario">
    **Year 1:** $1M daily volume
    - Annual buyback: $1.82M
    - Supply reduction: 2%
    
    **Year 2:** $5M daily volume (5x growth)
    - Annual buyback: $9.1M
    - Supply reduction: 8%
    
    **Year 3:** $20M daily volume
    - Annual buyback: $36.5M
    - Supply reduction: 25%+

## Real-World Impact

### Scenario Analysis

<CodeGroup>
```python Volume Growth Model
# Flywheel impact on token value
def calculate_flywheel_impact(daily_volume, years):
    annual_fees = daily_volume * 365 * 0.005
    buyback_amount = annual_fees * 0.8
    
    results = []
    for year in range(1, years + 1):
        # Assume 50% volume growth per year
        volume = daily_volume * (1.5 ** (year - 1))
        fees = volume * 365 * 0.005
        buyback = fees * 0.8
        
        results.append({
            'year': year,
            'daily_volume': f"${volume/1e6:.1f}M",
            'annual_buyback': f"${buyback/1e6:.1f}M"
        })
    
    return results

# Starting at $1M daily volume
print(calculate_flywheel_impact(1_000_000, 5))
```

```javascript Token Supply Impact
// Calculate supply reduction over time
function supplyImpact(initialSupply, annualBurnRate) {
  const years = 5;
  let supply = initialSupply;
  const results = [];
  
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    const burned = supply * (annualBurnRate / 100);
    supply -= burned;
    
    results.push({
      year,
      circulating: supply.toLocaleString(),
      burned: burned.toLocaleString(),
      reduction: ((1 - supply/initialSupply) * 100).toFixed(1) + '%'
    });
  }
  
  return results;
}

// 1B initial supply, 5% annual burn
console.log(supplyImpact(1_000_000_000, 5));

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Inflation" icon="ban">
    Fixed supply ensures buybacks always reduce circulation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protocol Owned" icon="building">

## Flywheel Governance

Token holders can vote on:

- Buyback frequency and thresholds
- Distribution ratios (stakers vs burns)
- Treasury management strategies
- Fee structure modifications

<Note>
  The flywheel parameters can evolve through governance, but the core mechanism of value flowing to token holders remains unchangeable.
</Note>
