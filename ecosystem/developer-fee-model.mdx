## The Sustainable Fee Model

Prediqt's developer fee model is designed to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits all participants while funding continuous platform improvements.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”„">
  Every fee collected contributes to the flywheel effect, creating value for token holders and improving the platform for all users.

## How Developer Fees Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fee Collection" icon="1">
    0.5% developer fee automatically collected on every trade
  </Step>
  <Step title="Treasury Accumulation" icon="2">
    Fees accumulate in the protocol treasury smart contract
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buyback Trigger" icon="3">
    When treasury reaches threshold, buyback mechanism activates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Purchase" icon="4">
    Treasury buys $PREDIQT from DEX at market price
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribution" icon="5">
    Purchased tokens distributed to stakers or burned
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Flywheel Effect

<Note>
  The developer fee model creates a self-reinforcing cycle that grows stronger with increased platform usage.

## Treasury Management

### Current Treasury Stats
<Info>
  Treasury holdings and buyback history are fully transparent and viewable on-chain at our [Treasury Dashboard](https://prediqtmarket.com/treasury).
</Info>

### Buyback Mechanics

<CodeGroup>
```solidity Smart Contract Logic
// Simplified buyback function
function executeBuyback() external {
    require(treasuryBalance >= BUYBACK_THRESHOLD, "Threshold not met");
    
    uint256 buybackAmount = treasuryBalance * BUYBACK_PERCENTAGE / 100;
    
    // Buy $PREDIQT from DEX
    uint256 tokensBought = swapSOLForPREDIQT(buybackAmount);
    
    // Distribute: 50% to stakers, 50% burned
    distributeToStakers(tokensBought / 2);
    burnTokens(tokensBought / 2);
    
    emit BuybackExecuted(buybackAmount, tokensBought);
}
```

```typescript Buyback Schedule
const BUYBACK_PARAMS = {
  threshold: 10000, // 10,000 SOL
  percentage: 80,   // Use 80% for buyback
  frequency: "WEEKLY",
  minPrice: 0,     // No minimum price
  maxSlippage: 3    // 3% max slippage
};
```
</CodeGroup>

## Fee Sustainability Model

### Revenue Projections

| Daily Volume | Daily Fees (0.5%) | Annual Revenue | Annual Buybacks |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| $1M | $5,000 | $1.825M | $1.46M |
| $5M | $25,000 | $9.125M | $7.3M |
| $10M | $50,000 | $18.25M | $14.6M |
| $50M | $250,000 | $91.25M | $73M |
