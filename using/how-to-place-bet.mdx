<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Market" icon="1">
    ### Finding the Right Market
    
    Browse markets using:
    - **Search Bar**: Type keywords for specific events
    - **Categories**: Filter by Politics, Sports, Crypto, etc.
    - **Trending**: See most active markets
    - **Closing Soon**: Markets about to resolve
    
    <Tip>
      Look for markets with high liquidity (>$10,000) for better pricing and easier exits.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analyze Market Data" icon="2">
    ### Understanding the Odds
    
    Check these key metrics:
    
    | Metric | What it Means |
    |--------|---------------|
    | **YES Price** | Current probability (e.g., $0.65 = 65%) |
    | **Volume** | Total amount bet (indicates interest) |
    | **Liquidity** | Available for instant trades |
    | **Holders** | Number of unique bettors |
    
    <Warning>
      Always read the "Resolution Criteria" carefully. This determines exactly how the market will be settled.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Calculate Your Position" icon="3">
    ### Position Sizing
    
    Use our built-in calculator or follow this formula:
    
    ```
    Potential Profit = (Number of Shares √ó $1.00) - Total Cost
    ROI = (Potential Profit / Total Cost) √ó 100%
    ```
    
    **Example**: Buying 100 YES shares at $0.60
    - Cost: 100 √ó $0.60 = $60
    - Payout if correct: 100 √ó $1.00 = $100
    - Profit: $100 - $60 = $40 (66.7% ROI)
  </Step>

    Buy/sell based on news or information others haven't processed yet. Speed matters in fast-moving markets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Arbitrage" icon="scale-balanced">
    Look for price discrepancies where YES + NO prices don't equal $1.00. Buy the underpriced side.
