## Understanding Payouts

Prediqtmarket uses a simple yet powerful payout mechanism: winning shares always pay exactly **$1.00** each, while losing shares become worthless.

<Note>
  Payouts are automatic and instant. As soon as a market resolves, smart contracts process all winning positions without any manual intervention needed.
</Note>

## The Binary Payout System

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Winning Shares = $1.00" icon="check-circle" color="#299EFF">
    Every winning share pays out exactly $1.00, regardless of purchase price
  </Card>
  <Card title="Losing Shares = $0.00" icon="x-circle" color="#299EFF">
    Losing shares expire worthless when the market resolves
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Payout Calculation

### Basic Formula

```
Payout = Number of Winning Shares Ã— $1.00
Profit = Payout - Initial Investment
ROI = (Profit / Initial Investment) Ã— 100%
```

### Example Calculations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Example 1: Small Win">
    **Market:** "Will Team A win tonight?"
    **Your bet:** 100 YES shares at $0.65 each
    **Cost:** $65
    **Outcome:** Team A wins âœ“
    
    **Payout:** 100 Ã— $1.00 = $100
    **Profit:** $100 - $65 = $35
    **ROI:** 53.8%
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example 2: Large Win">
    **Market:** "Will Bitcoin hit $50k this month?"
    **Your bet:** 1,000 NO shares at $0.25 each
    **Cost:** $250
    **Outcome:** Bitcoin stays below $50k âœ“
    
    **Payout:** 1,000 Ã— $1.00 = $1,000
    **Profit:** $1,000 - $250 = $750
    **ROI:** 300%
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example 3: Loss">
    **Market:** "Will X announce partnership?"
    **Your bet:** 500 YES shares at $0.80 each
    **Cost:** $400
    **Outcome:** No announcement âœ—
    
    **Payout:** $0
    **Loss:** $400
    **ROI:** -100%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Special Payout Scenarios

### Split Decisions

Some markets may have special conditions:

<Warning>
  Always read the resolution criteria carefully. Some markets may have conditions for partial payouts or specific tie-breaking rules.
</Warning>

**Example:** "Will the game end in regulation?"
- YES pays if game ends without overtime
- NO pays if game goes to overtime
- If game is cancelled: 50/50 split (each share worth $0.50)

### Invalid Markets

If a market cannot be resolved fairly:
1. Market is marked invalid
2. All shares are refunded at purchase price
3. Fees are returned
4. No profits or losses

## Tax Considerations

<Note>
  Prediction market winnings may be taxable in your jurisdiction. Prediqt provides transaction history for tax reporting, but users are responsible for their own tax compliance.

## Payout Calculator

Use this quick reference to calculate potential returns:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ROI Calculator
function calculatePayout(shares, purchasePrice, isWinner) {
  const investment = shares * purchasePrice;
  
  if (isWinner) {
    const payout = shares * 1.00;
    const profit = payout - investment;
    const roi = (profit / investment) * 100;
    
    return {
      investment,
      payout,
      profit,
      roi: roi.toFixed(1) + '%'
    };
  } else {
    return {
      investment,
      payout: 0,
      profit: -investment,
      roi: '-100%'
    };
  }
}
```

```python Quick Math
# Minimum ROI based on purchase price
purchase_prices = [0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90]
for price in purchase_prices:
    roi = ((1.00 - price) / price) * 100
    print(f"Buy at ${price}: {roi:.0f}% ROI if win")

# Output:
# Buy at $0.10: 900% ROI if win
# Buy at $0.25: 300% ROI if win
# Buy at $0.50: 100% ROI if win
# Buy at $0.75: 33% ROI if win
# Buy at $0.90: 11% ROI if win
```
