# How Markets Get Resolved

Market resolution is a critical part of the prediction market lifecycle. Here's how Prediqt ensures fair and accurate outcomes.

## Resolution Timeline

1. **Market closes**: No new trades allowed
2. **Outcome determination**: 1-48 hours typically
3. **Resolution posted**: Official result declared
4. **Settlement**: Automatic payout to winners

## Resolution Sources

### Primary Sources
Markets specify their resolution source upfront:
- **Official announcements**: Government agencies, companies
- **Verified results**: Sports leagues, election boards
- **Data providers**: Bloomberg, Reuters, AP
- **On-chain data**: Smart contract outcomes

### Backup Sources
If primary source fails:
- Pre-designated alternates
- Community consensus
- Prediqt committee decision
- Market cancellation (rare)

## The Resolution Process

### Step 1: Information Gathering
- Automated data feeds check sources
- Manual verification for complex outcomes
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Document all evidence

### Step 2: Initial Determination
- Resolution team reviews evidence
- Apply market rules strictly
- Consider edge cases
- Propose resolution

### Step 3: Review Period
- 2-hour window for objections
- High-value markets get extended review
- Community can flag issues
- Additional evidence considered

### Step 4: Final Resolution
- Official outcome posted
- Smart contract executes
- Payouts distributed
- Market archived

## Dispute Resolution

If users disagree with an outcome:

### Level 1: Quick Review
- Flag issue within 2 hours
- Provide contradicting evidence
- Fast-track reassessment
- Decision within 6 hours

### Level 2: Formal Dispute
- Submit detailed challenge
- Stake PREDIQT tokens
- Community jury reviews
- Binding decision

### Level 3: Emergency Committee
- For unprecedented situations
- Multi-sig governance
- Transparent process
- Final authority

## Special Situations

### Ambiguous Outcomes
When reality doesn't match market terms:
- Strict interpretation of rules
- Original intent considered
- Precedent from similar markets
- Fair resolution prioritized

### Cancelled Markets
Markets may be cancelled if:
- Question becomes invalid
- No clear resolution possible
- Technical errors discovered
- All traders refunded

### Split Resolutions
For complex scenarios:
- Partial payouts possible
- Proportional distribution
- Based on outcome probability
- Rare but fair solution

## Payout Mechanics

Once resolved:
1. Winning shares convert to 1 USDC each
2. Losing shares become worthless
3. Automatic distribution begins
4. Funds in wallet within minutes
5. Transaction record provided

## Resolution Examples

### Clear Resolution
**Market**: "Will the Lakers win Game 7?"
- **Source**: NBA official website
- **Result**: Lakers win 110-95
- **Resolution**: YES pays out

### Edge Case
**Market**: "Will inflation exceed 5% in Q1?"
- **Source**: Bureau of Labor Statistics
- **Result**: Exactly 5.0%
- **Resolution**: NO (must exceed, not equal)

### Disputed Resolution
**Market**: "Will Company X announce layoffs?"
- **Initial**: NO based on press release
- **Dispute**: Internal memo leaked
- **Review**: Memo verified as authentic
- **Final**: Reversed to YES

## Best Practices

- Read resolution criteria carefully
- Understand edge cases
- Keep evidence of your position
- Monitor market announcements
- Act quickly if disputing
