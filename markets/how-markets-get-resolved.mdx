Market resolution is a critical part of the prediction market lifecycle. On Prediqt, the process is handled by our team to ensure fair and accurate outcomes.

## The Resolution Process

1.  **Market Expiration**: When a market's end date is reached, trading is automatically halted. The market will no longer be displayed on the home page and awaits resolution.
2.  **Outcome Determination**: The Prediqt team determines the outcome based on the pre-defined resolution source for the market.
3.  **Resolution**: The team resolves the market via the admin dashboard, and the official result is posted.
4.  **Settlement**: Payouts are automatically distributed to users with winning shares.

## Resolution Sources

To ensure objectivity, every market has a resolution source specified at creation. The Prediqt team uses these sources to determine the outcome. These can include:
- **Official announcements**: Government agencies, companies
- **Verified results**: Sports leagues, election boards
- **Data providers**: Reputable news and data agencies
- **On-chain data**: Smart contract outcomes

If a primary source is unavailable or unclear, the team will use pre-designated backup sources to make a final determination.

## Payouts

Once a market is resolved:
1.  Losing shares become worthless.
2.  Your account will be automatically credited with the winnings.
3. You can claim your payout via the dashboard.
4.  You can view the transaction record in your wallet history.

## Special Situations

### Ambiguous Outcomes
In rare cases where the outcome is ambiguous, the Prediqt team will make a determination based on a strict interpretation of the market rules and the original intent of the market question.

### Cancelled Markets
A market may be cancelled by the team if the question becomes invalid or if a clear resolution is impossible. In this event, all funds traded in the market are returned to the users.
