## Who Creates Markets?

On Prediqt, all markets are created by the Prediqt team via an admin dashboard. This ensures that all markets meet our standards for clarity and fairness.

While users cannot create markets directly, we welcome suggestions from our community.

## Suggesting a New Market

If you have an idea for a market, you can suggest it in our community Discord. The Prediqt team regularly reviews these suggestions and will decide which new markets to create based on community interest and our market criteria.

## Market Requirements

To ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone, the Prediqt team follows strict guidelines when creating new markets.

### Clear Question
- Must be a binary (Yes/No) question.
- The question should be specific, measurable, and time-bound.
- It should not be open to subjective interpretation.

### Resolution Criteria
- A trusted and verifiable resolution source must be specified.
- The conditions for each outcome (Yes or No) must be clear.

### Examples of Good Markets

✅ "Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates at the March 2024 meeting?"
- Clear binary outcome
- Specific date
- Official source (Fed announcement)

✅ "Which team will win Super Bowl LVIII?"
- Clear winner/loser
- Defined event
- Official result

### Examples of Poor Markets

❌ "Will cryptocurrency be successful?"
- Too vague
- No time frame
- "Successful" is subjective

❌ "Will it rain tomorrow?"
- No location specified
- "Tomorrow" is relative
- No clear measurement
