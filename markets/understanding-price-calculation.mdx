# Understanding Price Calculation

Prices on Prediqt directly represent the market's collective assessment of probability. Here's how it works.

## The Basics

- Shares trade between 0 and 1 USDC
- Price = Implied probability
- 0.65 USDC = 65% chance
- Winning shares pay out 1 USDC
- Losing shares become worthless

## Price Discovery

Market prices are determined by:

### Supply and Demand
- More buyers → Price increases
- More sellers → Price decreases
- Equilibrium = Market probability

### Order Book Mechanics
1. **Limit orders**: Set your desired price
2. **Market orders**: Accept current best price
3. **Spread**: Difference between buy/sell prices
4. **Depth**: Amount available at each price

## Automated Market Maker (AMM)

Prediqt uses a hybrid system:
- AMM provides constant liquidity
- Order book for precise pricing
- Best of both worlds

### AMM Formula
```
Price = Shares_Outcome / Total_Shares
```

### Benefits
- Always liquid
- No waiting for counterparty
- Reduced slippage
- Fair pricing

## Real-Time Updates

Prices change based on:
- New trades executed
- Orders placed/cancelled
- External news/events
- Market sentiment shifts

## Example Calculation

**Market**: "Will Team A win the championship?"

Initial state:
- YES shares: 4,000
- NO shares: 6,000
- YES price: 0.40 (40%)

After big trade:
- Buy 1,000 YES shares
- New YES total: 5,000
- New price: 0.50 (50%)

## Price Impact

Large trades affect prices:
- Small trade (< $100): Minimal impact
- Medium trade ($100-$1,000): 1-3% move
- Large trade (> $1,000): 3-10% move

## Arbitrage Opportunities

Price differences create opportunities:
- Between related markets
- YES + NO should = 1.00
- Cross-platform differences
- Time-based arbitrage

## Important Concepts

### Slippage
The difference between expected and executed price due to:
- Market movement
- Order size
- Available liquidity

### Liquidity Pools
- Deeper pools = Stable prices
- Shallow pools = Volatile prices
- Check depth before large trades

### Price Limits
- Minimum: 0.01 (1%)
- Maximum: 0.99 (99%)
- Protects against manipulation
