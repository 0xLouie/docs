Prices on Prediqt markets reflect the crowd's wisdom about the probability of future events. Here's a breakdown of how it works.

## How Prices Work

The price of a share in a market represents the estimated probability of that outcome occurring.

- Share prices range from 0.01 to 0.99 USDC.
- A price of 0.65 USDC for a "Yes" share implies a 65% chance that the "Yes" outcome will occur.
- As users buy and sell shares, the prices change to reflect the market's collective belief.

If you buy shares for an outcome that comes true, each share you hold will be worth 1 USDC at resolution. If the outcome does not come true, those shares become worthless.

## Buying and Selling Shares

You can buy "Yes" or "No" shares for any active market. You can also sell your shares at any time before the market expires.

When you sell your shares, you are selling them back to the market at the current price. This allows you to lock in profits if the price has moved in your favor, or cut your losses if it has moved against you.

## Market Fees

Prediqt charges a 1% fee when you buy/sell your shares / at payout. This fee is deducted from the proceeds of your sale. 

## How Payouts Are Calculated

When a market resolves, winners receive a payout from the total pool of money from both "Yes" and "No" bets.

For example, if you bought "Yes" shares at 0.40 USDC and the "Yes" outcome is correct, each of your shares is now worth 1 USDC. Your profit is 0.60 USDC per share.

## Liquidity

Prediqt uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to ensure that you can always buy or sell shares, even if there isn't another user immediately available to take the other side of your trade. The AMM provides liquidity to the market, but be aware that large trades can still affect the price.

If you are the only one betting on an outcome, you will be trading against the AMM. Because of fees, it is possible to lose money even if you are on the winning side if there is very little opposing liquidity. This is a rare scenario in active markets.

## Price Discovery

Market prices are determined by:

### Supply and Demand
- More buyers → Price increases
- More sellers → Price decreases
- Equilibrium = Market probability

### Order Book Mechanics
1. **Limit orders**: Set your desired price
2. **Market orders**: Accept current best price
3. **Spread**: Difference between buy/sell prices
4. **Depth**: Amount available at each price

## Automated Market Maker (AMM)

Prediqt uses a hybrid system:
- AMM provides constant liquidity
- Order book for precise pricing
- Best of both worlds

### AMM Formula
```
Price = Shares_Outcome / Total_Shares
```

### Benefits
- Always liquid
- No waiting for counterparty
- Reduced slippage
- Fair pricing

## Real-Time Updates

Prices change based on:
- New trades executed
- Orders placed/cancelled
- External news/events
- Market sentiment shifts

## Example Calculation

**Market**: "Will Team A win the championship?"

Initial state:
- YES shares: 4,000
- NO shares: 6,000
- YES price: 0.40 (40%)

After big trade:
- Buy 1,000 YES shares
- New YES total: 5,000
- New price: 0.50 (50%)

## Price Impact

Large trades affect prices:
- Small trade (< $100): Minimal impact
- Medium trade ($100-$1,000): 1-3% move
- Large trade (> $1,000): 3-10% move

## Arbitrage Opportunities

Price differences create opportunities:
- Between related markets
- YES + NO should = 1.00
- Cross-platform differences
- Time-based arbitrage
