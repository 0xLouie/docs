Studies show prediction markets are often more accurate than pundits because they combine news, polls, and expert opinions into a single value that represents the market's view of an event's odds. Our markets reflect accurate, unbiased, and real-time probabilities for the events that matter most to you. Markets seek truth.

## Quick Overview

On Prediqt, you can buy and sell shares representing future event outcomes (e.g., "Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates at the next meeting?").

The price of the shares reflects the market's estimated probability of the event happening.


Unlike traditional betting, you're not just betting against "the house." You are trading in a dynamic market with other users. To ensure you can always place a trade, Prediqt uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to provide constant liquidity. This means:

-   Shares can be sold at any time before the event outcome is known (e.g., to lock in profits or cut losses).
-   The market is driven by the collective wisdom of its participants, not a central bookmaker.

## Understanding Prices

**Prices = Probabilities.**

The price on Prediqt represents the current probability of an event occurring. For example, in a market predicting the outcome of an election, if a candidate's "Yes" shares are trading at 62 cents, it indicates a 62% chance of that candidate winning, according to the market.

These odds are determined by the trades of other Prediqt users. Just as stock exchanges don't "set" the prices of stocks, Prediqt does not set the prices or oddsâ€”they're a function of supply and demand.

## Making Money on Markets

In the example above, if you believe the candidate's chances of winning are higher than 62%, you could buy "Yes" shares at 62 cents each. If that candidate wins, each "Yes" share you hold would be worth $1.00.

You have two ways to realize a profit:

1.  **Hold until resolution:** If your prediction is correct, you can claim your payout after the market is resolved.
2.  **Sell your shares early:** You can sell your shares at any time at the current market price. As news changes, the supply and demand for shares fluctuates, causing the share price to reflect the new odds for the event.

Prediqt charges a 1% fee on the value of a trade when you sell your shares or when you claim a payout at resolution.

## How accurate are Prediqt odds?

Research shows prediction markets are often more accurate than experts, polls, and pundits. Traders aggregate news, polls, and expert opinions, making informed trades. Their economic incentives ensure market prices adjust to reflect true odds as more knowledgeable participants join.

This makes prediction markets one of the best sources for real-time event probabilities. People use Prediqt for the most accurate odds, gaining the ability to make informed decisions about the future.

If you're an expert on a certain topic, Prediqt is your opportunity to profit from trading on your knowledge, while improving the market's accuracy.
